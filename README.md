# diabetes Data Analysis project 
## Introduction 
This project aims to analyze diabetes patient data to determine whether they are diabetic or not. We use data analysis techniques and machine learning to build a model that accurately predicts patients' conditions.

## Requirements
* Python
* **Libraries:**
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Data Cleaning 
The data was cleaned through several key steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset from the appropriate source.
2.  **Missing Values Check**: Identify any missing values and replace or remove them as necessary.
3.   **Data Filtering**: Remove unnecessary rows or columns to improve data quality.
4.  **Type Conversion**: Ensure all columns have the correct data types.

    ## Data Analysis
     After cleaning the data, the following libraries were used:
    **Pandas**: For data analysis and exploration.
     **NumPy**: For advanced numerical operations.
     **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: To create graphs and visualize the data.
  
 ## Model Building
   A prediction model was built using machine learning techniques with Scikit-learn to implement algorithms such as:
   * Logistic Regression

 ## Model Accuracy Testing
     To evaluate the model's performance, we used the **accuracy** metric. This metric represents the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions, providing insight into how well the model identifies diabetic patients accurately.

  ## Steps for Accuracy Testing:
 1. Split the data into a training set and a testing set.
 2. Train the model on the training set.
 3.  Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance.
 4. Calculate accuracy using functions available in the Scikit-learn library
